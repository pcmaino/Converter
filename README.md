# Converter

Description: This app performs a couple of operations and conversions found in the puzzle game "Zero Escape: 999",
and could be used as a companion app for it.

Operations: 
- Digital Root: Adds up any amount of numbers. If the number is double digit or more, adds up each digit of the number,
  which will produce the digital root.
    Ex: 1 6 8, 1+6+8=15, 1+5=6, the digital root of 1, 6, and 8 is 6.
   
- Base 36 to Base 10 Converter: Converts a number in base 36 to base 10.
