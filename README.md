# Converter

Description: This app performs a couple of operations and conversions found in the puzzle game "Zero Escape: 999",
and could be used as a companion app for it. While playing the game, constantly having to stop and write out certain reoccuring puzzle ascpects got annoying, so this app could help aliviate that.

Operations: 
- Digital Root: Adds up any amount of numbers. If the number is double digit or more, adds up each digit of the number,
  which will produce the digital root.
    Ex: (1 6 8), 1+6+8=15, 1+5=6, the digital root of 1, 6, and 8 is 6.
   
- Base 36 to Base 10 Converter: Converts a number in base 36 to base 10.
- Base 10 to Base 36 Converter: Converts a number in base 10 to base 36.

***Note***
There are very obvious gaps from Aug 30 to Sep in my commits. This is because I was having issues with Adnroid Studio, the emulator, and the Gradle. Please excuse these gaps in submission for this project if possible, I was working on getting my stuff working during that time. Everything should be fine now, so this won't be an issue in future projects. Thank you.
